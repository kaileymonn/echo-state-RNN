# Elmnann RNN
Simple implementation of Elmann in tensorflow to test freeze_graph.py functionality. 

# Notes:
Found many issues with freeze_graph.py in terms of usability, especially difficulty in determining correct output-tensor-name for c-line usage. Currently completing build of a separate module for tensorflow model saving and exporting for deployment/analysis (without Tensorboard).
